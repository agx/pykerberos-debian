Package: python-kerberos
Architecture: any
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Provides: ${python:Provides}
Description: GSSAPI interface module - Python 2.x
 This Python package is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.
 The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire
 Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what
 is needed for client/server Kerberos authentication based on
 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.
 .
 Much of the C-code here is adapted from Apache's mod_auth_kerb-5.0rc7.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x module.
